# Action Scheduler Custom Tables [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Prospress/action-scheduler-custom-tables.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Prospress/action-scheduler-custom-tables) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Prospress/action-scheduler-custom-tables/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Prospress/action-scheduler-custom-tables)

**This plugin is no longer needed. The code in it is now part of [Action Scheduler version 3.0](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler) and newer. If you're using the latest Action Scheduler, you have the best schema possible. This plugin was to prototype custom tables and test it on various large sites in advance of moving Action Scheduler core to custom tables.**
